## Contributions:

**Jan**: Jan has mostly worked on the debate page to make sure that it's fully functional and connected to the firebase database. He also collaborated with Joel Loo for the elections page. After Joel wrote the code for pulling the address data from the Google Civic Information API for all of the polling locations, Jan integrated a geocode api that parses through the addresses and coverts them into coordinates to visualize points on the map. He also worked on creating the basic wireframes and creating a consistent style for the app.
